Background

The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom and assigns them a food hygiene rating. I have been contracted by the editors of the food magazine "Eat Safe, Love" to analyze some of the ratings data to assist their journalists and food critics in deciding where to focus future articles.

Instructions

Part 1: Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up

Import the provided data into MongoDB.
Verify the data is properly loaded by listing databases and collections.
Assign the collection to a variable for further use.
Part 2: Update the Database

Add a new restaurant to the database.
Find and update the BusinessTypeID for the new restaurant.
Part 3: Exploratory Analysis

Answer specific questions to help determine the locations for future articles.
Utilize queries to find establishments with certain hygiene scores and ratings.
Convert results to Pandas DataFrames for better visualization.
Part 4: Aggregation Pipeline

Create an aggregation pipeline to determine the number of establishments with a hygiene score of 0 in each Local Authority area.
Sort the results from highest to lowest and print the top ten local authority areas.
Additional Information

To complete this activity, I utilized resources such as Office Hours and the assistance of ChatGPT to debug and optimize the code. Additionally, ChatGPT was instrumental in using the .shape attribute, which helped me represent the number of rows in the DataFrames.
